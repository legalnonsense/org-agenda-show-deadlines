#+TITLE: org-agenda-show-deadlines

Show deadlines in org-agenda buffers. 
Update: This package now also shows active timestamps and deadlines. Deadlines take precedence. Not planning to add a toggle to turn off deadlines since I do not anticipate using that feature. 

* Installation / Requirements
This package requires [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el][ts.el]]. 

Put =org-agenda-show-deadlines.el= in your load path, and ~(require 'org-agenda-show-deadlines)~ or use =use-package= to the same effect. 
* Usage
Toggle showing  deadlines with =(org-agenda-show-deadlines-mode)=. The sole effect of this the minor mode is to add a function to =org-agenda-finalize-hook= which will insert the deadline text before the agenda is finalized. 

Enabling the mode will not refresh the agenda. Refresh manually when toggling on or off. 
* Examples
Here are three examples run on the following agenda file:
#+begin_src org 
 * TODO Pay bills
DEADLINE: <2020-01-31 Fri>
 * TODO Finalize stuff
DEADLINE: <2020-02-08 Sat>
#+end_src 
The first shows the default settings. 

The second shows: ~(setq org-agenda-show-deadlines-date-format  "%B %d, %Y")~ 

The third shows: ~(setq org-agenda-show-deadlines-fill-char " ")~, ~(setq org-agenda-show-deadlines-next-line-p t)~, and ~(setq org-agenda-show-deadlines-column 14)~:

* Customization
The following variables can be customized:
| Custom variable                                 | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ~org-agenda-show-deadlines-column~                | The column in which the deadline will appear. If this creates a collision with agenda text, it will alert the user. Default: =100= |
| ~org-agenda-show-deadlines-next-line-p~           | Whether the deadlines are inserted on the line following an agenda entry (=t=), or on the same line (=nil=). Default: =nil=.           |
| ~org-agenda-show-deadlines-fill-char~             | Character to fill space between the entry and the deadline. Default: =.=. =_= also works. Use a space for no fill.                   |
| ~org-agenda-show-deadlines-date-format~           | Format to use to display the deadline date. Follows the format of =format-time-string=. Default: =%Y-%m-%d= i.e., =YYYY-MM-DD=.        |
| ~org-agenda-show-deadlines-final-change-function~ | A user-supplied function to apply any changes to the deadline string before it is inserted. Default: =nil=.                        |
